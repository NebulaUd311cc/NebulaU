A free, ad-free, space-themed online game is now available!

The game is based on blockchain technology, and each game map requires players to participate in creating the foundation.

Every player can use software to generate their own planet file, called "Planets."

Players who generate Planets files are rewarded with Crystals, which are given daily for keeping the game connected.

Crystals can be bought and sold among players, with a current rate of 1000 Crystals to 1 USDT.

Nebula U has the advantage of low computer requirements, with only the Planets files (101GB) taking up hard drive space. Players can generate many Planets files and simply leave the software running to earn Crystals each day.

It's a lazy gamer's dream come true, with no investment or effort required!

To register for Nebula U, all you need is an email address.

Nebula U has a wide range of use cases. It's not just for personal computers; it can also be used on long-term computers such as office machines. The more planet files you generate, the more rewards you can earn.
